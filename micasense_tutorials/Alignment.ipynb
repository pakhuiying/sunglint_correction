    "# Active Image Alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In most use cases, each band of a multispectral capture must be aligned with the other bands in order to create meaningful data.  In this tutorial, we show how to align the band to each other using open source OpenCV utilities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Image alignment allows the combination of images into true-color (RGB) and false color (such as CIR) composites, useful for scouting using single images as well as for display and management uses.  In addition to composite images, alignment allows the calculation of pixel-accurate indices such as NDVI or NDRE at the single image level which can be very useful for applications like plant counting and coverage estimations, where mosaicing artifacts may otherwise skew analysis results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The image alignment method described below tends to work well on images with abundant image features, or areas of significant contrast.  Cars, buildings, parking lots, and roads tend to provide the best results.  This approach may not work well on images which contain few features or very repetitive features, such as full canopy row crops or fields of repetitive small crops such lettuce or strawberries.  We will disscuss more about the advantages and disadvantages of these methods below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions behind this alignment process can work with most versions of RedEdge and Altum firmware. They will work best with versions above 3.2.0 which include the \"RigRelatives\" tags. These tags provide a starting point for the image transformation and can help to ensure convergence of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opening Images\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have done in previous examples, we use the micasense.capture class to open, radiometrically correct, and visualize the 5 bands of a RedEdge capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll load the `autoreload` extension.  This lets us change underlying code (such as library functions) without having to reload the entire workbook and kernel. This is useful in this workbook because the cell that runs the alignment can take a long time to run, so with `autoreload` extension we can update the code after the alignment step for analysis and visualization without needing to re-compute the alignments each time."

    "## Unwarp and Align\n",
    "\n",
    "Alignment is a three step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Images are unwarped using the built-in lens calibration\n",
    "1. A transformation is found to align each band to a common band\n",
    "1. The aligned images are combined and cropped, removing pixels which don't overlap in all bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide utilities to find the alignement transformations within a single capture.  Our experience shows that once a good alignmnet transformation is found, it tends to be stable over a flight and, in most cases, over many flights.  The transformation may change if the camera undergoes a shock event (such as a hard landing or drop) or if the temperature changes substantially between flights.  In these events a new transformation may need to be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, since this approach finds a 2-dimensional (affine) transformation between images, it won't work when the parallax between bands results in a 3-dimensional depth field.  This can happen if very close to the target or when targets are visible at significantly different ranges, such as a nearby tree or building against a background much farther way. In these cases it will be necessary to use photogrammetry techniques to find a 3-dimensional mapping between images.\n",
    "\n",
    "For best alignment results it's good to select a capture which has features which visible in all bands.  Man-made objects such as cars, roads, and buildings tend to work very well, while captures of only repeating crop rows tend to work poorly.  Remember, once a good transformation has been found for flight, it can be generally be applied across all of the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also good to use an image for alignment which is taken near the same level above ground as the rest of the flights. Above approximately 35m AGL, the alignement will be consistent. However, if images taken closer to the ground are used, such as panel images, the same alignment transformation will not work for the flight data.  "

    "After finding image alignments we may need to remove pixels around the edges which aren't present in every image in the capture.  To do this we use the affine transforms found above and the image distortions from the image metadata.  OpenCV provides a couple of handy helpers for this task in the  `cv2.undistortPoints()` and `cv2.transform()` methods.  These methods takes a set of pixel coordinates and apply our undistortion matrix and our affine transform, respectively.  So, just as we did when registering the images, we first apply the undistortion process the coordinates of the image borders, then we apply the affine transformation to that result. The resulting pixel coordinates tell us where the image borders end up after this pair of transformations, and we can then crop the resultant image to these coordinates."

    "### Notes on Alignment and Stack Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Stacks\" as described above are useful in a number of processing cases.  For example, at the time of this writing, many photogrammetry suites could import and process stack files without significantly impacting the radiometric processing which has already been accomplished.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Running photogrammetry on stack files instead of raw image files has both advantages and drawbacks. The primary advantage has been found to be an increase in processing speed and a reduction in program memory usage. As the photogrammetric workflow generally operates on luminance images and may not use color information, stacked images may require similar resources and be processed at a similar speed as single-band images.  This is because one band of the stack can be used to generate the matching feature space while the others are ignored for matching purposes. This reduces the feature space 5-fold over matching using all images separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "One disadvantage is that stacking images outside of the photogrammetric workflow may result in poor image matching.  The RedEdge is known to have stable lens characteristics over the course of normal operation, but variations in temperature or impacts to the camera through handling or rough landings may change the image alignment parameters.  For this reason, we recommend finding a matching transformation for each flight (each take-off and landing).  Alignment transformations from multiple images within a flight can be compared to find the best transformation to apply to the set of the flight.  While not described or supported in this generic implementation, some matching algorithms can use a \"seed\" value as a starting point to speed up matching.  For most cases, this seed could be the transformation found in a previous flight, or another source of a known good transformation.    "

This plot can be useful for visualizing row crops and plots the Red Reflectance channel on the X-axis against the NIR reflectance channel on the Y-axis. This plot also clearly shows the line of the soil in that space.  The tassled cap view isn't very useful for this arid data set; however, we can see the \"badge of trees\" of high NIR reflectance and relatively low red reflectance. This provides an example of one of the uses of aligned images for single capture analysis."
