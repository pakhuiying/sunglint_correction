This is useful in this workbook because the cell that runs the alignment can take a long time to run, so with `autoreload` extension we can update the code after the alignment step for analysis and visualization without needing to re-compute the alignments each time."

    "This notebook aims to create a calibration curve for radiometric correction under different illumination conditions. Without effective radiometric calibration, drone imagery heavily suffers from sun illumination affected by time of day, cloud, and other weather conditions. UAV sensors are vulnerable to vibration and wind effect during flight. Their radiometric properties may also be impacted by other environmental variations such as temperature, solar illumination, and weather conditions. Therefore, even with calibrated sensors, in situ calibration is often needed to improve accuracies of quantitative applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common in situ calibration approach is the Empirical Line Method (ELM) to build the relationships between the reflectance of calibrated targets and their top-of-atmosphere radiance (at sensor radiance). It requires the real-time reflectance measurements of multiple artificial or natural targets. Some studies explored the irradiance-based ELM calibration by considering the aerosol effects in the relationship. This empirical calibration is often time consuming and not practical efficient. The real-time field spectra may not be needed when a reference standard is employed in field. The RedEdge system utilises a pre-calibration reflectance panel (CRP) set up in field and a Downwelling Light Sensor (DLS) mounted atop a drone to capture the hemispherical irradiance during the flight. The current procedure of RedEdge image correction mostly utilises the CRP panel itself and some studies have reported the relatively higher percent errors of its radiometric calibration. With the bar code embedded on the panel, the CRP reflectance can be automatically recognised in image processing packages."

We just need to solve for $a,b$ from the CRP_DLS irradiance regression. Both CRP and DLS are made of diffuse materials and therefore possess a common relationshop between their irradiance recordings. The study relies on all calibration data collected in multiple flights at different study sites to build the CRP-DLS relationship."
